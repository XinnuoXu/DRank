# msr_dialog_ranking

After releasing their dialogue system (DS) to users, developers can improve the systemâ€™s performance by correcting mistakes the system made in dialogues and retraining the DS model on the labeled data. However, going through all dialogues is time consuming. So we need a ranker to detect dialogues with lower quality automatically to make this dialogue learning process with human-in-the-loop efficient. Also, gathering labeled data for supervised learning is time consuming. Therefore, we are building a unsupervised pointwise neural ranker.

## Quickstart <br />

### Environment set up
Since references are based on different environment, we use [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) to set up environment for each regerence. Please run the following codes to set up miniconda. After the installation, you can run `conda --help` to test.

```
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

echo ". ~/miniconda2/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
echo ". ~/miniconda2/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" >> ~/.benv
source ~/.benv
```

### AMT data collection <br />
AMT data collection is working in `AMT/`. We need to create a conda enviornment first by running

```
conda create -n AMT python=3; conda activate AMT
```

AMT data collection is based on [ParlAI](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/blob/master/README.md). To install ParlAI, please run the following command in folder `AMT/`.

```
python setup.py develop
```

To start the data collection, you need to run `sh run.sh` in folder `AMT/parlai/mturk/tasks/pydail_collection/`. If you run the script for the first time, it will ask for `Access Key ID` and `Secret Access Key`. Then, register your email address at [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/) and run `/home/xxu/msr_dialog_ranking/AMT/parlai/mturk/core/heroku-cli-v6.99.0-ec9edad-linux-x64/bin/heroku login` at the terminal to login to Heroku. The `Access Key ID` and `Secret Access Key` we are using are

```
Access Key ID: AKIAIE57EGXOXHCR3TWA
Secret Access Key: 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
```

If you see the following information when you run `sh run.sh`, it means that you setup everything correctly. You can visit the `Link to HIT` to see your task.

Run the following scripts to process the raw data collected from AMT.  

```
python log_reading.py > AMT_dials.txt
python log_preprocess.py
```
After running the preprocessing, the following files are generated. `AMT_preprocessed.txt` is a file with all dialogues and rated scores. `generated_dial_examples_*` are positive and negative examples for supervised learning that we will explain later.

* `AMT_preprocessed.txt`
* `generated_dial_examples_dev.neg`
* `generated_dial_examples_dev.pos`
* `generated_dial_examples_test.neg`
* `generated_dial_examples_test.pos`
* `generated_dial_examples_train.neg`
* `generated_dial_examples_train.pos`


### Step2: Train a language model <br />

```
cd lm/tool/
```

In this step, we will train a language model based on the responses for the MMI-anti model (example data `data/*.vi`). Since this language model will be used in the MMI-anti model, it will share the dictionary (`data/*.vocab.pt`) generated in `Step1`.

#### Step2.1: Preprocess the data <br /> 

```
python preprocess.py
```

These preprocessing will turn all responses for the MMI-anti model (example data `data/*.vi`) into parallel data for the language model. 


After running the preprocessing, the following files are generated in `lm/data/` folder:

* `train.en`
* `train.de`
* `dev.en`
* `dev.de`

For example, the response `"they just want a story"` in file `data/train.vi` will be preprocessed in to `"<s> they just want a story"` in file `lm/data/train.en` and `"they just want a story </s>"` in file `lm/data/train.de`.

#### Step2.2: Train a language model <br />

```
cd ../
python lm.py
```

This train command will save the language model to `lm/model.pt`.

To run this code on the CPU, you need to update your pytorch to any version after `24th Feb 2018` and make sure that this piece of code can be found in your `torchtext/data/iterator.py`:

```
if not torch.cuda.is_available() and self.device is None:
  self.device = -1
```

#### Step2.3: Test your language model <br />

```
python generate.py
```

This tool will generate 1000 utterances randomly using the language model `lm/model.pt` and save them into file `lm/generated.txt`.


#### Step2.4: Go back to our MMI-anti model <br />

```
cd ../
```

### Step3: Train a MMI-anti model <br />

```
python train.py
```

### Step4: Generate <br />

```
python translate.py -model model_name
```

The generation results will be saved in file `pred.txt`.

### Step5: Evaluate the diversity? <br />

```
cat pred.txt | python diversity.py
```
